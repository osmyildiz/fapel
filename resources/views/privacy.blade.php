Our Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.

It is important to us that you take the time to read this policy carefully. Remember, you have access to controls that allow you to manage your information and protect your privacy and security. We have made every effort to keep this policy as clear and concise as possible.

                                            At our company, we take the protection of our customers' personal data very seriously. You have the right to access, correct, and delete any personal information we have about you, as well as to object to its processing. We have implemented security measures to ensure the privacy and security of your data and to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, corruption, or destruction. However, please be aware that we cannot eliminate all risks associated with using the Internet. We advise our website users of these potential risks. Our website may contain links to other websites or external sources that we do not control. We cannot be held responsible for the content, advertising, products, services, or any other material available on or from these external sources.

                                            Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our
                                            services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a personal account.
                                            We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using
                                            technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on
                                            your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For example, we
                                            supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use
                                            services from other companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order
                                            to customize certain services to your location. The data we collect depends on the services
                                            and features you use.
                                        </p>

                                            At TCR BAR, we understand the importance of your personal data and take your privacy seriously. When you make a booking with us, we collect and use your data solely for the purpose of identifying and accommodating your reservation. We do not use your data for any other purpose, such as marketing or advertising, without your explicit consent. We are committed to ensuring that your personal information remains confidential and protected at all times.

                                            We only share your personal data with your explicit consent or as required to complete any transaction or service you have requested or authorized. For example, we do not share your content with third parties unless you give us permission to do so. When you provide payment information to make a purchase, we only share it with banks and other entities involved in processing payment transactions or providing other financial services, and only for the purposes of fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. We do not share personal data with any external parties except for our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries, and vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. In such cases, these companies are required to abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not permitted to use personal data for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data in the event of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets, but only in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
